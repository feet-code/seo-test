Metrics for makerspace equipment training authorization tracking should help community makerspaces, fabrication labs, and shared technical workshops decide what to change next. Avoid universal benchmarks: volume, service model, and exception mix differ. Establish a baseline from your own records and compare the process against itself.

## Three useful measures

| Metric | Simple calculation | Decision it supports |
|---|---|---|
| Authorization publication time | access state updated - trainer decision | reduce handoff |
| Access-state accuracy | members whose system access matches authorization / audited members | protect controls |
| Expired-use attempts | attempts by expired authorization / access attempts | test enforcement |

## Capture the minimum viable data

The calculations only work if the operating record consistently includes Member membership and status, Equipment and authorization level, Policy waiver and orientation version, Training date curriculum and trainer, Practical check evidence and decision, Restrictions expiry and renewal rule, Booking and access-control publication, Suspension exception and review history. Define when the clock starts and stops. Decide whether paused or waiting time remains inside cycle time, and keep that rule stable across the comparison period.

## Segment before interpreting

Separate normal work from exception-heavy work. At minimum, segment by owner, workflow stage, and closed reason. Averages can hide a small blocked queue that creates most of the follow-up burden.

## Review decisions, not dashboard colors

For each metric, write an action threshold in plain language. Examples:

- If Authorization publication time changes materially, use it to reduce handoff.
- If Access-state accuracy changes materially, use it to protect controls.
- If Expired-use attempts changes materially, use it to test enforcement.

Do not automate a response until a person has reviewed several examples. A high number can indicate a broken process, difficult work, or a data-definition change.

## Validate each calculation manually

Choose one closed record and calculate every metric by hand from its timestamps and statuses. Save the numerator, denominator, exclusions, and timezone rule beside the definition. Then test an abandoned record, a reopened record, and a record that spent time waiting. If two people produce different answers, the metric is not ready for a dashboard. Fix the event definitions before collecting more data.

Repeat that spot check whenever a workflow status, integration, or reporting period changes.

## A four-week measurement loop

Week one defines fields and baselines. Week two fixes missing data. Week three tests one workflow change. Week four compares the same metric definitions and reviews exceptions. Keep the change only if it improves the intended outcome without shifting work somewhere invisible.
