There are several valid ways to manage MSP client access request approval. The right choice depends on volume, exception rate, ownership, and how much coordination crosses systems. Start with the smallest approach that keeps the work reliable.

## Option comparison

| Approach | Best when | Main limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Ticket comments, technician chats, email approvals, and runbooks | One owner handles low volume and can see every open item | Status and follow-up history depend on memory and inbox searches |
| PSA workflows or a shared service-delivery board | The team already maintains it and exceptions are simple | Purpose-built reminders, evidence, and stop conditions require manual setup |
| A focused workflow tool | The same coordination failure repeats across many live records | It must integrate with the system of record and justify another workflow |

## Choose the manual option when

One owner can see the entire queue, the workflow changes often, and missed handoffs are rare. Document the process anyway so growth does not depend on that person's memory.

## Choose a general platform when

The team already uses it consistently and the workflow shares records with adjacent work. Confirm that statuses, reminders, and permissions can be configured without creating a second shadow spreadsheet.

## Choose a focused tool when

- a request lacks a recognized client approver
- the requested permission exceeds the user's peer group
- temporary access reaches its expiry or the employee status changes

A focused tool should reduce those specific coordination costs. If it merely presents the same data in a prettier view, the migration is unlikely to pay off.

## Run a two-week experiment

Select ten live records. Implement Client and tenant, Requester and verification method, Affected identity, System and requested permission, Business reason and duration, Approver and approval evidence, Technician and verification result, Completion, expiry, or rollback record, and follow this sequence: Validate the requester and affected identity → Classify access scope and risk → Obtain the required client approval → Implement and independently verify the change → Notify the requester and close with evidence. Track Approval lead time, Provisioning accuracy, Expired access backlog. At the end, review every exception and ask whether the tool made the next action clearer.

## Preserve reversibility

Export the trial data, document status definitions, and keep the previous process available until the new one completes a full cycle. A good decision is not just about features; it is about whether the team can adopt, operate, and leave the system without losing its history.

Record the decision date and the conditions that would justify reviewing the choice again.

## Next step

[Explore the Client Access Request Gate workflow concept](/products/client-access-request-gate) and record whether this is painful enough to justify a focused tool.
