Metrics for hotel lost and found claim tracking should help independent boutique hotels and small hospitality teams decide what to change next. Avoid universal benchmarks: volume, service model, and exception mix differ. Establish a baseline from your own records and compare the process against itself.

## Three useful measures

| Metric | Simple calculation | Decision it supports |
|---|---|---|
| Claim resolution time | closed time - claim opened time | set cross-shift review cadence |
| Custody completeness | items with complete location history / items registered | audit storage controls |
| Verified return rate | items released to verified claimants / found items | evaluate intake and matching |

## Capture the minimum viable data

The calculations only work if the operating record consistently includes Hotel, room area, and found time, Item category and nonpublic identifiers, Finder and custody events, Storage location, Claimant and stay reference, Verification questions and match decision, Pickup or shipping authorization, Release recipient or policy disposition. Define when the clock starts and stops. Decide whether paused or waiting time remains inside cycle time, and keep that rule stable across the comparison period.

## Segment before interpreting

Separate normal work from exception-heavy work. At minimum, segment by owner, workflow stage, and closed reason. Averages can hide a small blocked queue that creates most of the follow-up burden.

## Review decisions, not dashboard colors

For each metric, write an action threshold in plain language. Examples:

- If Claim resolution time changes materially, use it to set cross-shift review cadence.
- If Custody completeness changes materially, use it to audit storage controls.
- If Verified return rate changes materially, use it to evaluate intake and matching.

Do not automate a response until a person has reviewed several examples. A high number can indicate a broken process, difficult work, or a data-definition change.

## Validate each calculation manually

Choose one closed record and calculate every metric by hand from its timestamps and statuses. Save the numerator, denominator, exclusions, and timezone rule beside the definition. Then test an abandoned record, a reopened record, and a record that spent time waiting. If two people produce different answers, the metric is not ready for a dashboard. Fix the event definitions before collecting more data.

Repeat that spot check whenever a workflow status, integration, or reporting period changes.

## A four-week measurement loop

Week one defines fields and baselines. Week two fixes missing data. Week three tests one workflow change. Week four compares the same metric definitions and reviews exceptions. Keep the change only if it improves the intended outcome without shifting work somewhere invisible.
