Metrics for repair estimate authorization tracking should help independent auto repair shops and service-advisor teams decide what to change next. Avoid universal benchmarks: volume, service model, and exception mix differ. Establish a baseline from your own records and compare the process against itself.

## Three useful measures

| Metric | Simple calculation | Decision it supports |
|---|---|---|
| Authorization response time | decision time - estimate delivered time | adjust follow-up timing and channel |
| Pending estimate age | current time - oldest unresolved delivery time | prioritize stalled repair orders |
| Authorized value rate | authorized estimate value / estimate value presented | find services that need clearer explanation |

## Capture the minimum viable data

The calculations only work if the operating record consistently includes Repair order and vehicle, Estimate version and amount, Work items awaiting approval, Customer and preferred channel, Estimate delivered time, Current decision status, Owner and next follow-up, Authorization evidence or closed reason. Define when the clock starts and stops. Decide whether paused or waiting time remains inside cycle time, and keep that rule stable across the comparison period.

## Segment before interpreting

Separate normal work from exception-heavy work. At minimum, segment by owner, workflow stage, and closed reason. Averages can hide a small blocked queue that creates most of the follow-up burden.

## Review decisions, not dashboard colors

For each metric, write an action threshold in plain language. Examples:

- If Authorization response time changes materially, use it to adjust follow-up timing and channel.
- If Pending estimate age changes materially, use it to prioritize stalled repair orders.
- If Authorized value rate changes materially, use it to find services that need clearer explanation.

Do not automate a response until a person has reviewed several examples. A high number can indicate a broken process, difficult work, or a data-definition change.

## Validate each calculation manually

Choose one closed record and calculate every metric by hand from its timestamps and statuses. Save the numerator, denominator, exclusions, and timezone rule beside the definition. Then test an abandoned record, a reopened record, and a record that spent time waiting. If two people produce different answers, the metric is not ready for a dashboard. Fix the event definitions before collecting more data.

Repeat that spot check whenever a workflow status, integration, or reporting period changes.

## A four-week measurement loop

Week one defines fields and baselines. Week two fixes missing data. Week three tests one workflow change. Week four compares the same metric definitions and reviews exceptions. Keep the change only if it improves the intended outcome without shifting work somewhere invisible.
