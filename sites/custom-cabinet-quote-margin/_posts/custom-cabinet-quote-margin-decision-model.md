Complexity and finish labor are undercounted while generic per-foot pricing ignores constrained shop time. A useful calculation for custom cabinet estimating and job costing should help independent custom cabinet and millwork shops make a specific margin decision and produce this outcome: **Produces a capacity-aware quote and learns labor and material factors from completed jobs**.

The product hypothesis is: Builds quotes from boxes, doors, finish, hardware, design, install, material yield, outsourced work, and shop capacity. The model should expose its assumptions and compare the eventual result with the forecast. Avoid universal benchmarks because volume, service model, cost structure, and exception mix differ. Establish a baseline from the buyer's own records and compare the decision process against itself.

## Start with the economic question

High-ticket custom work and explicit software/calculator searches create a strong wedge and willingness to pay. Write that question at the top of the model. If an input cannot change the recommendation or explain the result, keep it out of the first version.

## Three useful measures

### Incremental gross profit or avoided loss

- **Calculation:** realized revenue plus avoided loss minus variable and capacity cost
- **Use it to:** keep only actions that create a positive realized contribution

### Financial realization rate

- **Calculation:** realized financial result divided by the approved expected result
- **Use it to:** find recommendations whose promised value does not survive execution

### Forecast error

- **Calculation:** absolute expected-versus-realized difference divided by the realized result
- **Use it to:** recalibrate assumptions or separate unlike cases

### Decision cycle time

- **Calculation:** approved-action timestamp minus qualifying-trigger timestamp
- **Use it to:** remove delays that cause an otherwise valuable opportunity to expire

## Capture the minimum viable data

The calculations only work if the operating record consistently includes source record and reporting period, customer, job, asset, location, or contract identifier, revenue or avoided-loss amount, variable cost and allocated capacity cost, volume, timing, utilization, or risk inputs, recommended action, owner, confidence, and review date. Define when the clock starts and stops. Decide whether paused or waiting time remains inside cycle time, and keep that rule stable across the comparison period.

## Segment before interpreting

Separate normal work from exception-heavy work. At minimum, segment by owner, workflow stage, and closed reason. Averages can hide a small blocked queue that creates most of the follow-up burden.

## Review decisions, not dashboard colors

For each metric, write an action threshold in plain language. Examples:

- If incremental gross profit or avoided loss changes materially, use it to keep only actions that create a positive realized contribution.
- If financial realization rate changes materially, use it to find recommendations whose promised value does not survive execution.
- If forecast error changes materially, use it to recalibrate assumptions or separate unlike cases.
- If decision cycle time changes materially, use it to remove delays that cause an otherwise valuable opportunity to expire.

Do not automate a response until a person has reviewed several examples. A high number can indicate a broken process, difficult work, or a data-definition change.

## Validate each calculation manually

Choose one closed record and calculate every metric by hand from its timestamps and statuses. Save the numerator, denominator, exclusions, and timezone rule beside the definition. Then test an abandoned record, a reopened record, and a record that spent time waiting. If two people produce different answers, the metric is not ready for a dashboard. Fix the event definitions before collecting more data.

Repeat that spot check whenever a workflow status, integration, or reporting period changes.

Test the model against these deliberately different cases before relying on it:

- a high-revenue case that becomes unattractive after variable costs
- an underused capacity slot where a targeted action creates incremental margin
- an exception whose missing evidence would otherwise hide revenue or increase risk

The point is not to produce one impressive answer. It is to show that the same definitions handle an attractive case, a constrained-capacity case, and an exception with incomplete evidence.

## A four-week measurement loop

Week one defines fields and baselines. Week two fixes missing data. Week three tests one workflow change. Week four compares the same metric definitions and reviews exceptions. Keep the change only if it improves the intended outcome without shifting work somewhere invisible.
