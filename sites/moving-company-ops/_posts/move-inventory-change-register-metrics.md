Metrics for moving inventory change authorization should help independent household moving companies and local moving crews decide what to change next. Avoid universal benchmarks: volume, service model, and exception mix differ. Establish a baseline from your own records and compare the process against itself.

## Three useful measures

| Metric | Simple calculation | Decision it supports |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-work authorization rate | material changes authorized before work / material changes | tighten estimator-to-crew handoff |
| Change review time | decision time - change reported time | staff day-of approvals |
| Post-move scope disputes | moves with disputed change / moves with changes | improve evidence and signoff |

## Capture the minimum viable data

The calculations only work if the operating record consistently includes Customer, move, and estimate, Original and changed inventory, Change source and time, Origin or destination access change, Labor, vehicle, equipment, and date impact, Price and valuation impact, Customer and operations approval, Effective version and crew acknowledgment. Define when the clock starts and stops. Decide whether paused or waiting time remains inside cycle time, and keep that rule stable across the comparison period.

## Segment before interpreting

Separate normal work from exception-heavy work. At minimum, segment by owner, workflow stage, and closed reason. Averages can hide a small blocked queue that creates most of the follow-up burden.

## Review decisions, not dashboard colors

For each metric, write an action threshold in plain language. Examples:

- If Pre-work authorization rate changes materially, use it to tighten estimator-to-crew handoff.
- If Change review time changes materially, use it to staff day-of approvals.
- If Post-move scope disputes changes materially, use it to improve evidence and signoff.

Do not automate a response until a person has reviewed several examples. A high number can indicate a broken process, difficult work, or a data-definition change.

## Validate each calculation manually

Choose one closed record and calculate every metric by hand from its timestamps and statuses. Save the numerator, denominator, exclusions, and timezone rule beside the definition. Then test an abandoned record, a reopened record, and a record that spent time waiting. If two people produce different answers, the metric is not ready for a dashboard. Fix the event definitions before collecting more data.

Repeat that spot check whenever a workflow status, integration, or reporting period changes.

## A four-week measurement loop

Week one defines fields and baselines. Week two fixes missing data. Week three tests one workflow change. Week four compares the same metric definitions and reviews exceptions. Keep the change only if it improves the intended outcome without shifting work somewhere invisible.
